# PowerBi Project Repository

I developed a straightforward interactive dashboard in Power BI to monitor my personal finances. This project involved several key steps:

1. Data Integration: I gathered and imported financial data from various sources, such as bank statements and expense records, into Power BI.

2. Measures and Calculations: I created measures using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to perform calculations and generate key financial metrics, such as total income, total expenses, savings, and budget variances.

3. Visualizations: I utilized a variety of visualizations, including cards, bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs, to represent the financial data clearly and intuitively. These visualizations allowed for easy tracking and comparison of different financial aspects over time.

4. Interactivity: I added interactive elements like slicers and filters, enabling users to explore the data dynamically. For instance, I could filter expenses by category or time period, to gain deeper insights.

5. User-Friendly Design: I ensured the dashboard was user-friendly, with a clean and organized layout, making it easy to navigate and understand.

This Power BI dashboard provided a comprehensive view of my personal finances, helping me to track spending, manage budgets, and make informed financial decisions.
